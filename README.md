## Engineering Philosophy

**Clean Architecture First**  
Code should scream its intent. I implement Screaming Architecture principles to ensure applications are maintainable, testable, and clearly organized.

**Developer Experience Matters**  
Great tools enable great software. I focus on creating development environments that reduce friction and help teams move faster.

**Interactive by Design**  
Modern web applications should engage users beyond traditional interfaces. I explore the intersection of mathematics, physics, and web technologies.

## Community & Learning

Active contributor to the 100Devs developer community with focus on practical application development and mentoring. Self-directed learning approach with emphasis on hands-on projects and open source contribution focused on developer productivity.
